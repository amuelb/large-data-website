## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- need to add a "Categories" menu item so that users can get there instead of using the side bar
- need to activate search menu

### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- Nothing to report

### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- need to add arrows to the banner for side scrolling
