**Description:**

Add sweet sophistication to classic lemon meringue pie with these parfaits piled high with fresh raspberries, creamy lemon custard and a lightly browned meringue topping.

**Ingredients:** 

- 1	jar(s) (10 oz) lemon curd
- 1	cup(s) fat-free sour cream
- Yellow liquid food color
- 1 container(s) (4 oz) raspberries
- 4	teaspoon(s) powdered egg whites or 1 cup whipped cream
- 1/2 teaspoon(s) vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup(s) granulated sugar

**Directions:**

1. You'll need eight 4-oz glasses and a small butane torch (see Note).
2. Whisk lemon curd in large bowl until smooth. Stir in small amount of sour cream to lighten; fold in remaining sour cream and a few drops of food color.
3. Place 6 to 7 raspberries in bottom of each glass. Spoon 1/4 cup lemon mixture on top. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 1 day.
4. Stir powdered egg whites into 1/4 cup warm water in a bowl until dissolved. Beat with mixer until frothy. Add vanilla; turn speed to high, adding sugar 1 Tbsp at a time until soft, shiny peaks form when beaters are lifted.
5. Put meringue in large ziptop bag; snip 3/4 in. from one corner. Pipe so that meringue mounds above glass rim.
6. Holding small butane torch about 5 in. above meringue, lightly brown meringue for just a few seconds. Do not allow flame to get near the rim of the glass. If torch is not available, top with whipped cream instead. 
7. Serve immediately, or refrigerate up to 1 hour.
