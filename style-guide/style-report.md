**Favourite Elements**

I personally find that the use of cookie-crumbs at the top of the body will help users to remember their location on the webpage.

Since the web is all about sharing these days, having links for social media can help spread around the website which can bring in more traffic. Along with the social media, I also included an *onsite* comments section where users can post their own thoughts and opinions on the recipe along with a overall rating on the dish.

Because it is a large-data site, I decided to keep the search options visible to the user on every page. This can help them narrow down their searches by category, difficulty, time, and rating, or by simply typing in what they are looking for.

##Concept 1

**Pros**

This design is simple, clean and using a very uplifting colour scheme. The colours are commonly used with desserts and give a *sweet* feeling to the page. The icons used with the ingredients list help users to visualize what they will need for their recipe.

**Cons**

The colours could be considered feminine or *girly* to the average user. It could also make the website come across as a little childish and more like it was created for teens than for high skilled chefs.

##Concept 2

**Pros**

This design is bold and edgey. The colours stand out and the type gives the webpage a *magazine* feel. The change in colour removes all gender based stereotyping and adds a bit of masculinity to the site.

**Cons**

The type in the titles and headers is a little thin and might he harder for older folks to read. It also might look a little too modern for some generations with its thin type, bold colours, and flat design. The social media icons look less unified.

##Concept 3

**Pros**

The colours on this page give off a happy feeling and make desserts look much lighter than they actually are (almost like they aren't as bad for you). The thick type for the headers and subheads is easy for all ages to read and gives a *Better Homes and Gardens* vibe.

**Cons**

The yellow may show up lighter on some users screens and limit visibility and readability. The comment box looks like it might be overcomplicated to code and may be unnecessarily decorated.
