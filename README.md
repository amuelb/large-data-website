# Dessert Recipes

Desserts are the best part of any meal. They can be mixed, baked, fried, and frozen and come in many different colours and flavours. Different desserts are catered to different peoples tastes and can have fruits, chocolates, nuts, and even salt. 
Though desserts can be expensive to buy in stores they can easily be made at home using recipies you find online or in a cookbook. 

##Purpose

This project is a college level in-school project designed to teach us about making design systems for large-scale websites. 

I'm excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
